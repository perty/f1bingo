A user can have one palette per race weekend.
A palette can have one or more bingo cards,
depending on the type of race weekend.

A statement can either be true or false for a given
part of a race weekend, that is called a result.

A statement is suitable for one or more of the following sessions:
qualification, race, sprint shootout and sprint race.

A bingo card can have 16 statements, arranged in a
4x4 grid.

Given a user and a race weekend, there is a palette of bingo cards.

No login is required as a user can have only one palette.
